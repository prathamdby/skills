# Autoplan

Analysis only. Deliver one plan in thread, or at the caller's named path.

## Options and triage

Default: current repo, standard depth, thread output. Quick/sketch uses Shape
and Risks with always-on lenses. Thorough/risky/migration uses deep, winning
over quick; a named area scopes evidence. Resolve conflicting scope narrowly
and record both readings under Assumptions; never ask.

Before evidence, `BLOCKED` if no groundable verb/object/area, a non-repo intent
has no plannable target, or building rather than planning was requested.
Name the missing piece and one workable example; emit no lenses/map/milestones
on refusal. A build request does not authorize product edits by this skill.

Trivial means one module, no contract/data/signature change, and one-sentence
behavior. Return `DIRECT` plus that sentence and three lines: shape, files,
first step; no lenses. Otherwise record `intent | scope | depth | terminal`.
Done when triage has a terminal or a grounded target.

## 1. Evidence

Check whether the requested contract already exists; harden an existing match,
not rebuild it. Locate sibling recon's installed `SKILL.md` to resolve its
anchor and shared/legacy memory rules. Read a repository-verified snapshot
whose head resolves; do not invoke a refresh merely to read it. Without usable
memory, cold-scan at most three anchors for each of at most 30 manifest modules.
Missing recon is not an evidence dependency: use that bounded scan instead.

Scan ADR trees (`docs/adr/`, `adr/`, `doc/adr/`, `docs/decisions/`) silently
when absent. Note TODOs, recent reverts, and duplication. Dirty content is an
Assumptions overlay, not proof of existing contracts. Every later claim cites
a path/test/ADR, a scoped no-match result, or an explicit missing-evidence
Assumption; cite inherited patterns. Done when material claims have provenance.

## 2. Lenses

Apply all always-on probes in `REFERENCE.md`: contracts/API, failure/rollback,
longevity/debt. For a leaf, playbook, or matcher, also apply
`references/router-contracts.md`.

Score every probe for each activated lens, turning a hit into a cited risk
owned by a plan step; close each lens pass with cite, risk → step, or no evidence.
Deep activates all. Otherwise load only triggered lenses:
- Schema/backfill, stored artifacts, toolchain: `references/data.md`.
- External consumers/stored payloads: `references/compatibility.md`.
- Auth/secrets/PII/untrusted input: `references/security.md`.
- Hot paths/cost-bearing calls: `references/cost.md`.
- Services/deployment/paging: `references/operations.md`.
State one skip line per inactive lens. Done when every active probe is scored
and each risk has an owner.

## 3. Plan

Specify decisions, changed contracts, constraints, and deviations from cited
patterns, not implementation bodies or restatements. Standard/deep includes:
Assumptions; Shape (bold sentence + pattern); Layer map (NEW/CHANGED roles);
phase sequence; file-plus-symbol grounding (prose: file + contract step);
worst-first Risks (probability × impact, or stated judgment); Milestones;
non-goals; Handoff. Sketch includes only Shape and Risks.

Small work is one PR; otherwise each milestone is a reviewable vertical PR.
Begin with the thinnest end-to-end contract/check slice. Name landed symbols,
expected success and relevant failure outcomes, and assertions or observed
manual results proving them. Exit zero alone is not proof.
Handoff names `/peer-review`, then ship; docs-only work stops at peer-review.
Done with `PLANNED` when behavior is grounded or assumed, risks are owned,
and every milestone has outcome-linked checks.

Terminals: `PLANNED`, `DIRECT`, `BLOCKED`.
